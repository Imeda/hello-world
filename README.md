# hello-world
just doing the git tutorial
hey this is just a tutorial okay? just getting used on git. yes. that's it. oh! about myself? Well i'm here for a reason. i have a lecture called grundgebiete der informatik4. i'm simultaneously learning to code in C (again ha) and trying out github so that i can commit to the "Ã¼bung" held every week on friday. well yeah that's it.
